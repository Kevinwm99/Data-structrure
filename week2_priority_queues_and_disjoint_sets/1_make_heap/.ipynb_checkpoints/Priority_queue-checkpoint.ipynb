    "# Priority Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "A priority queue is a genernalisation of a queue where each element is assigneed a priority and elements come out in order by priority\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "insert(val): this function will insert an element into the priority queue \n",
    "\n",
    "extractMax(): this function will get the element with the highest priority out of the queue\n",
    "\n",
    "remove(it): removes an elemnet pointed by an iterator\n",
    "\n",
    "getMax(): returns an element with the maximum priority without extracting it out of the queue\n",
    "\n",
    "change_Priority(it,p): changes the priority of an element pointed by 'it' to 'p'\\\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to implement this data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive way to do it is by using unsorted array or list to implement it. The insert() operation will take O(1) time, however it is not sufficient because the operations extractMax() will take O(n) times complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other way is to use sorted array, then extractMax() will take O(1) time complexity, but insert(val) will take possibly O(n) time. The insert(val) operation will first find a position for val (O(logn)) by using binary search. Then shift all elements to the right of it by 1 (O(n)). If we use sorted list the result will be the same\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimal solution for implement priority queue is by Binary Heap\n",
    "#### Binary max-heap: \n",
    "is a binary tree (each node has zero, one or two children) where the value of each node is at least the values of its children. Max element is at the root and children's value cannot be greater than its parent.\n",
