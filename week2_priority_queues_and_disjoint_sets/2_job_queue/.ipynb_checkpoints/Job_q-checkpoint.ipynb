    "## Problem description\n",
    "### Task.\n",
    "You have a program which is parallelized and uses 𝑛 independent threads to process the given list of 𝑚 jobs. Threads take jobs in the order they are given in the input. If there is a free thread, it immediately takes the next job from the list. If a thread has started processing a job, it doesn’t interrupt or stop until it finishes processing the job. If several threads try to take jobs from the list simultaneously, the thread with smaller index takes the job. For each job you know exactly how long will it take any thread to process this job, and this time is the same for all the threads. You need to determine for each job which thread will process it and when will it start processing.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first line of the input contains integers $n$ and $m$\n",
    "\n",

    "The times are given in the same order as they are in the list from which threads take jobs.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Output format.\n",
    "Output exactly $m$ lines. $i-th$ line (0-based index is used) should contain two space-separated integers - the 0-based index of the thread which will process the i-th job and the time in seconds when it will start processing that job.\n",

    "In this problem, I see that we can ultilize the build_heap function which is implemented in **Problem 1**, so I developed into a Priority Queue using the exact same mechanism. \n",
    "\n",
    "After we have the priority class, we also need to create a Worker class which represents the Thread, this class have 2 attributes: id and nextfreetime. ID is the the id of the worker, nextfreetime is the time that this worker will be free. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's special about this class is that I have built buildt-in functions to compare different objects in the same class. Since we want to put these objects into the Priority Queue, we need to compare it efficiently. The **__lt__()** and **__gt__()** are the magic functions in python which let us to do so. All we need to do is modified these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we need a function to process the parallel works. This function will iterate the jobs list, for each job we pop out the worker with the lowest priority (min heap is used in this case) which indicates that it free enough to take the next job. All the sortings will be done by Priority Queue. The complexity of this function is O(n) where n is the jobs"
